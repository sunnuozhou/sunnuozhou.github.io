I am a third-year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). I am currently visiting [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu/) as a student intern, hosted by [Aayush Jain](https://sites.google.com/view/aayushjain/home).

I have a broad interest in theoretical computer science, especially theoretical cryptography. I have also worked on projects related to online algorithms.

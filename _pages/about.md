I am a fourth-year undergraduate student in the [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), majoring in Computer Science at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). After graduation, I will be pursuing a Ph.D. in the Computer Science Department at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/).

My research interests lie broadly in theoretical computer science, with a particular focus on theoretical cryptography. I have also worked on projects involving online algorithms. For more details about my research and academic background, please refer to my publications.
